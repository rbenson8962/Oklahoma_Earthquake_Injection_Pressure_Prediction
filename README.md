# Investigating the Relationships between the Arbuckle Formation Injection Pressures and Induced Seismicity

During my career as a geophysicist I was apart of operations that were concerned about induced seismicity in Norther Oklahoma.

This investigation is the 2nd piece of my self directed research from that time.  It's the project that I didn't get to before our big layoff and is the perfect project for me to practice and transition into a Data Science career.

To begin, we will first need some basic understanding of what a fault is, conceptually what it looks like, and how it moves relative to itself.

# What is a fault?
It is a planar fracture or "tear" within a volume of rock, such as the planet Earth, where displacement or movement has occured causing a discontinuity between two sides.

I'm looking for when the Arbuckle began to "fill up" as the system reached equilibrium. Beyond equilibrium, the formation starts to push back against the injectors. It is at this point where problems start occurring. Faults are under immense stress and when formation pressures push fluids in between fault planes, they act as lubrication due to the incompressibility of water. This lubricity changes a system that was at equilibrium and increases stress along the fault plane above and below the fluid invasion zones. The reason for the increased stress is because the fluid is causing slippage already but is undetectable: the fault is slipping aseismically! There are no earthquakes associated with this slippage. The earthquake will come from the unlubricated locations above and below on the fault plane and it is at these locations where we see the seismicity as they finally slip.

For some background, a fault does not move all at once. They act more like a millipede where slippage occurs along the plane in isolated locations but are still part of a mechanical ecosystem. A slippage at point A will create increased stress at Point B and C. If point C can't handle the additional stress over time, it slips as well, increasing stress at point B even further. Point B can't handle the double stress increase and slips as well creating new stress at a point D etc etc.

My hypothesis is that there will be a positive correlation between Arbuckle formation pressures and northern Oklahoma seismicity.
