We were actively encouraged to practice willfull ignorance on this top where even muttering the word "Earthquake" could cause silence in a room.  Don't think about it, don't mention it, don't do ANYTHING that could be used by a lawyer as evidence that the company knew what was going on.  They bent over backwards to find anything to explain it away.  I once sat through a small presentation where a Manager showed that the moon was causing seismic tides.  Rediculous on so many levels!  It got so bad, company access to our own internal geophone arrays were restricted and locked away.
